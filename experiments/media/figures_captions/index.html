    <h1>Semantically Identifying Figures &amp; Captions</h1>
    <h2>Figure</h2>
    <p>The figure block-level element is used to identify and wrap self-contained content, often in the form of media. It may surround images, audio clips, videos, blocks of code, diagrams, illustrations, or other self-contained media. More than one item of self-contained content, such as multiple images or videos, may be contained within the figure element at a time. If the figure element is moved from the main portion of a page to another location (for example, the bottom of the page), it should not disrupt the content or legibility of the page.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/29841/dog.jpg">
        <figcaption>A beautiful black, brown, and white hound dog wearing kerchief.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>To add a caption or legend to the figure element, the figcaption element is used. The figcaption may appear at the top of, bottom of, or anywhere within the figure element; however, it may only appear once. When it’s used, the figcaption element will serve as the caption for all content within the figure element.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the figcaption element may replace an img element’s alt attribute if the content of the figcaption element provides a useful description of the visual content of the image.</p>
