    <h3>Positioning Images</h3>
    <p>We can use a number of different approaches to position images on a web page. By default images are positioned as
        inline-level elements; however, their positions may be changed using CSS, specifically the float, display, and
        box model properties, including padding, border, and margin.</p>

    <h4>Inline Positioning Images</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is by default an inline-level element. Adding an image without any styles to
        a page will position that image within the same line as the content that surrounds it. Additionally, the height
        of the line in which an image appears will be changed to match the height of the image, which can create large
        vertical gaps within that line.</p>

    <h4>Block Positioning Images</h4>
    <p>Adding the display property to an image and setting its value to block forces the image to be a block-level
        element. This makes the image appear on its own line, allowing the surrounding content to be positioned above
        and below the image.</p>

    <h4>Positioning Images Flush Left or Right</h4>
    <p>Sometimes displaying an image as inline or block, or perhaps even inline-block, isn’t ideal. We may want the
        image to appear on the left or right side of its containing element, while all of the other content wraps around
        the image as necessary. To do this, we use the float property with a value of either left or right.</p>

    <h4>When to Use an Image Element vs a Background Image</h4>
    <p>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element within HTML is the preferred option when the image being used holds semantic value and its
        content is relevant to the content of the page.</p>
        <p>The background or background-image property within CSS is the preferred option when the image being used is part of the design or user interface of the page. As such, it’s not directly relevant to the content of the page.</p>
