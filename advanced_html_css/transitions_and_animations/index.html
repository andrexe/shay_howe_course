    <h1>Transitions &amp; Animations</h1>

    <p>One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers
        have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript
        or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.</p>
    <p>With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state
        change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.</p>
    <p>Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes.
        Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition
        upon different keyframes.</p>

    <h2>Transitions</h2>

    <p>As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must
        be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the
        :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.</p>
    <p>There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration,
        transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the
        first three are the most popular.</p>
    <p>In the example below the box will change its background color over the course of 1 second in a linear fashion.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            transition-property: background;
            transition-duration: 1s;
            transition-timing-function: linear;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Transitions Demo</h4>

    <div class="box">Box</div>

    <h4>Vendor Prefixes</h4>

    <p>The code above, as with the rest of the code samples in this lesson, are not vendor prefixed. This is
        intentionally un-prefixed in the interest of keeping the code snippet small and comprehensible. For the best
        support across all browsers, use vendor prefixes.</p>

    <p>For reference, the prefixed version of the code above would look like the following.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            -webkit-transition-property: background;
               -moz-transition-property: background;
                 -o-transition-property: background;
                    transition-property: background;
            -webkit-transition-duration: 1s;
               -moz-transition-duration: 1s;
                 -o-transition-duration: 1s;
                    transition-duration: 1s;
            -webkit-transition-timing-function: linear;
               -moz-transition-timing-function: linear;
                 -o-transition-timing-function: linear;
                    transition-timing-function: linear;
        }
        .box:hover {
          background: #ff7b29;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Transitional Property</h3>

    <p>The transition-property property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other
        transitional properties. By default, all of the properties within an element’s different states will be altered
        upon change. However, only the properties identified within the transition-property value will be affected by
        any transitions.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the background property is identified in the transition-property value. Here the background
        property is the only property that will change over the duration of 1 second in a linear fashion. Any other
        properties included when changing an element’s state, but not included within the transition-property value,
        will not receive the transition behaviors as set by the transition-duration or transition-timing-function
        properties.</p>
    <p>If multiple properties need to be transitioned they may be comma separated within the transition-property value.
        Additionally, the keyword value all may be used to transition all properties of an element.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            border-radius: 6px
            transition-property: background, border-radius;
            transition-duration: 1s;
            transition-timing-function: linear;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
            border-radius: 50%;
        }
    </code></pre>

    </div>

    <h4>Transitional Properties</h4>

    <p>It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable
        halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have
        recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it
        does not have any midpoint. A handful of the more popular transitional properties include the following.</p>


    <ul>
        <li>background-color</li>
        <li>background-position</li>
        <li>border-color</li>
        <li>border-width</li>
        <li>border-spacing</li>
        <li>bottom</li>
        <li>clip</li>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>crop</li>
        <li>font-size</li>
        <li>font-weight</li>
        <li>height</li>
        <li>left</li>
        <li>letter-spacing</li>
        <li>line-height</li>
        <li>margin</li>
        <li>max-height</li>
        <li>max-width</li>
        <li>min-height</li>
        <li>min-width</li>
        <li>opacity</li>
        <li>outline-color</li>
        <li>outline-offset</li>
        <li>outline-width</li>
        <li>padding</li>
        <li>right</li>
        <li>text-indent</li>
        <li>text-shadow</li>
        <li>top</li>
        <li>vertical-align</li>
        <li>visibility</li>
        <li>width</li>
        <li>word-spacing</li>
        <li>z-index</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Transition Duration</h3>

    <p>The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this
        property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing
        values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.</p>
    <p>When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property. As with the
        transition-property property value, multiple durations can be declared using comma separated values. The order
        of these values when identifying individual properties and durations does matter. For example, the first
        property identified within the transition-property property will match up with the first time identified within
        the transition-duration property, and so forth.</p>
    <p>If multiple properties are being transitioned with only one duration value declared, that one value will be the
        duration of all the transitioned properties.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            border-radius: 6px;
            transition-property: background, border-radius;
            transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
            transition-timing-function: linear;
          }
          .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
            border-radius: 50%;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Transition Duration Demo</h4>

    <div class="transition-duration">

        <div class="box">Box</div>

    </div>

    <h3>Transition Timing</h3>

    <p>The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the
        duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A
        few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in,
        ease-out, and ease-in-out.</p>
    <p>The linear keyword value identifies a transition moving in a constant speed from one state to another. The
        ease-in value identifies a transition that starts slowly and speeds up throughout the transition, while the
        ease-out value identifies a transition that starts quickly and slows down throughout the transition. The
        ease-in-out value identifies a transition that starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again
        before ending.</p>
    <p>Each timing function has a cubic-bezier curve behind it, which can be specifically set using the cubic-bezier(x1,
        y1, x2, y2) value. Additional values include step-start, step-stop, and a uniquely identified
        steps(number_of_steps, direction) value.</p>
    <p>When transitioning multiple properties, you can identify multiple timing functions. These timing function values,
        as with other transition property values, may be declared as comma separated values.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            border-radius: 6px;
            transition-property: background, border-radius;
            transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
            transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
            border-radius: 50%;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Transition Timing Demo</h4>

    <div class="transition-timing">

        <div class="box">Box</div>

    </div>

    <h3>Transition Delay</h3>

    <p>On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the
        transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a
        transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous
        transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            border-radius: 6px
            transition-property: background, border-radius;
            transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
            transition-timing-function: linear, ease-in;
            transition-delay: 0s, 1s;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
            border-radius: 50%;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Transition Delay Demo</h4>

    <h2>Shorthand Transitions</h2>

    <p>Declaring every transition property individually can become quite intensive, especially with vendor prefixes.
        Fortunately there is a shorthand property, transition, capable of supporting all of these different properties
        and values. Using the transition value alone, you can set every transition value in the order of
        transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and lastly transition-delay. Do not use
        commas with these values unless you are identifying numerous transitions.</p>
    <p>To set numerous transitions at once, set each individual group of transition values, then use a comma to separate
        each additional group of transition values.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .box {
            background: #2db34a;
            border-radius: 6px;
            transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;
        }
        .box:hover {
            background: #ff7b29;
            border-radius: 50%;
        }

    <h2>Animations</h2>

    <p>Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for
        these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple
        states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.</p>

    <h3>Animations Keyframes</h3>

    <p>To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes
        rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.</p>

    <pre><code>
        @keyframes slide {
            0% {
              left: 0;
              top: 0;
            }
            50% {
              left: 244px;
              top: 100px;
            }
            100% {
              left: 488px;
              top: 0;
            }
          }
    </code></pre>

    <h4>Vendor Prefixing the Keyframe Rule</h4>
    <p>The @keyframes rule must be vendor prefixed, just like all of the other transition and animation properties. The
        vendor prefixes for the @keyframes rule look like the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>@-moz-keyframes</li>
        <li>@-o-keyframes</li>
        <li>@-webkit-keyframes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The animation above is named slide, stated directly after the opening @keyframes rule. The different keyframe
        breakpoints are set using percentages, starting at 0% and working to 100% with an intermediate breakpoint at
        50%. The keywords from and to could be used in place of 0% and 100% if wished. Additional breakpoints, besides
        50%, may also be stated. The element properties to be animated are listed inside each of the breakpoints, left
        and top in the example above.</p>
    <p>It is important to note, as with transitions only individual properties may be animated. Consider how you might
        move an element from top to bottom for example. Trying to animate from top: 0; to bottom: 0; will not work,
        because animations can only apply a transition within a single property, not from one property to another. In
        this case, the element will need to be animated from top: 0; to top: 100%;.</p>

    <h4>Animations Keyframes Demo</h4>
    <p>Hover over the ball below to see the animation in action.</p>

    <div class="animation-keyframes">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Animation Name</h3>

    <p>Once the keyframes for an animation have been declared they need to be assigned to an element. To do so, the
        animation-name property is used with the animation name, identified from the @keyframes rule, as the property
        value. The animation-name declaration is applied to the element in which the animation is to be applied to.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Using the animation-name property alone isn’t enough though. You also need to declare an animation-duration
        property and value so that the browser knows how long an animation should take to complete.</p>

    <h3>Animation Duration, Timing Function, & Delay</h3>

    <p>Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions.
        They include a duration, timing function, and delay if desired. To start, animations need a duration declared
        using the animation-duration property. As with transitions, the duration may be set in seconds or milliseconds.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <p>Using the animation-name property alone isn’t enough though. You also need to declare an animation-duration
        property and value so that the browser knows how long an animation should take to complete.</p>

    <h3>Animation Duration, Timing Function, &amp; Delay</h3>

    <p>Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions.
        They include a duration, timing function, and delay if desired. To start, animations need a duration declared
        using the animation-duration property. As with transitions, the duration may be set in seconds or milliseconds.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>A timing function and delay can be declared using the animation-timing-function and animation-delay properties
        respectively. The values for these properties mimic and behave just as they do with transitions.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;
        }
    </code></pre>

    <p>The animation below should cause the ball to bounce once while moving to the left, however only when hovering
        over the stage.</p>

    <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="stage"&gt;
            &lt;figure class="ball"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <pre><code>
        @keyframes slide {
            0% {
              left: 0;

            }
            50% {
              left: 244px;
              top: 100px;
            }
            100% {

          .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;

    <h2>Customizing Animations</h2>

    <p>Animations also provide the ability to further customize an element’s behavior, including the ability to declare
        the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.</p>

    <h3>Animation Iteration</h3>

    <p>By default, animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop. To have an animation repeat
        itself numerous times the animation-iteration-count property may be used. Values for the
        animation-iteration-count property include either an integer or the infinite keyword. Using an integer will
        repeat the animation as many times as specified, while the infinite keyword will repeat the animation
        indefinitely in a never ending fashion.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <div class="animation-iteration">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Animation Direction</h3>

    <p>On top of being able to set the number of times an animation repeats, you may also declare the direction an
        animation completes using the animation-direction property. Values for the animation-direction property include
        normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.</p>
    <p>The normal value plays an animation as intended from beginning to end. The reverse value will play the animation
        exactly opposite as identified within the @keyframes rule, thus starting at 100% and working backwards to 0%.
    </p>
    <p>The alternate value will play an animation forwards then backwards. Within the keyframes that includes running
        forward from 0% to 100% and then backwards from 100% to 0%. Using the animation-iteration-count property may
        limit the number of times an animation runs both forwards and backwards. The count starts at 1 running an
        animation forwards from 0% to 100%, then adds 1 running an animation backwards from 100% to 0%. Combining for a
        total of 2 iterations. The alternate value also inverses any timing functions when playing in reverse. If an
        animation uses the ease-in value going from 0% to 100%, it then uses the ease-out value going from 100% to 0%.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, the alternate-reverse value combines both the alternate and reverse values, running an animation
        backwards then forwards. The alternate-reverse value starts at 100% running to 0% and then back to 100% again.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            animation-direction: alternate;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <div class="animation-direction">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Animation Play State</h3>

    <p>The animation-play-state property allows an animation to be played or paused using the running and paused keyword
        values respectively. When you play a paused animation, it will resume running from its current state rather than
        starting from the very beginning again.</p>
    <p>In the example below the animation-play-state property is set to paused when making the stage active by clicking
        on it. Notice how the animation will temporarily pause until you let up on the mouse.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            animation-direction: alternate;
          }
          .stage:active .ball {
            animation-play-state: paused;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <div class="animation-play-state">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Animation Fill Mode</h3>

    <p>The animation-fill-mode property identifies how an element should be styled either before, after, or before and
        after an animation is run. The animation-fill-mode property accepts four keyword values, including none,
        forwards, backwards, and both.</p>
    <p>The none value will not apply any styles to an element before or after an animation has been run.</p>
    <p>The forwards value will keep the styles declared within the last specified keyframe. These styles may, however,
        be affected by the animation-direction and animation-iteration-count property values, changing exactly where an
        animation ends.</p>
    <p>The backwards value will apply the styles within the first specified keyframe as soon as being identified, before
        the animation has been run. This does include applying those styles during any time that may be set within an
        animation delay. The backwards value may also be affected by the animation-direction property value.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the both value will apply the behaviors from both the forwards and backwards values.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation-name: slide;
            animation-duration: 2s;
            animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
            animation-delay: .5s;
            animation-fill-mode: forwards;
          }
          .stage:active .ball {
            animation-play-state: paused;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <div class="animation-fill-mode">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
        </div>

    </div>

    <h2>Shorthand Animations</h2>

    <p>Fortunately animations, just like transitions, can be written out in a shorthand format. This is accomplished
        with one animation property, rather than multiple declarations. The order of values within the animation
        property should be animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay,
        animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-fill-mode, and lastly animation-play-state.</p>

    <pre><code>
        .stage:hover .ball {
            animation: slide 2s ease-in-out .5s infinite alternate;
          }
          .stage:active .ball {
            animation-play-state: paused;
          }
    </code></pre>

    <div class="shorthand-animations">

        <div class="stage">
            <figure class="ball"></figure>
