    <h1>Detailed CSS Positioning</h1>

    <h2>Containing Floats</h2>

    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>

    <p>The DOM, or Document Object Model, is an API for HTML and XML documents which provides their structural
        representation. In our case, we are speaking specifically to HTML documents, thus the DOM represents all of the
        different elements and their relationship to each other.</p>
    <p>The representation can be considered a tree of sorts, with each element having a different relationship with
        those around it. Elements nested inside others have a parent and child relationship while elements that share
        the same parent have a sibling relationship.</p>

    <p>While floats do provide quite a bit of fire power, they do come with a few of their own problems. The most
        popular problem involves a parent element that contains numerous floated elements. Content on the page will
        respect the size and placement of the floated children element, but these floated elements no longer impact the
        outer edges of the parent container. In this event the parent element loses context of exactly what it contains
        and collapses, thus giving the parent element a height of 0 and ignoring various other properties. A lot of
        times this may go unnoticed, specifically when the parent element doesn’t have any styles tied to it and the
        nested elements look to have aligned correctly.</p>

    <p>Should the nested elements not line up correctly, styling errors may appear. Taking a look at the demo below, the
        .box-set division should have a light gray background, however the background is not seen as all of the elements
        nested within it are floated. Upon inspecting the .box-set division you will see it has a height of 0.</p>

    <div class="box-set">
        <figure class="box">Box 1</figure>
        <figure class="box">Box 2</figure>
        <figure class="box">Box 3</figure>
    </div>

    <p>One way to force containing these floats would be to place an empty element just before the parent elements
        closing tag, of which would need to include the style declaration clear: both;. Clearing the floats this way
        works and is valid in most cases, but it isn’t exactly semantic. Depending on how many different floats need to
        be cleared on a page the number of empty elements can begin to stack up quickly, while not providing any real
        contextual value to the page.</p>

    <p>Fortunately there are a couple of different techniques we can use to contain these floats, the most popular of
        which include the overflow technique and the clearfix technique.</p>

    <h3>The Overflow Technique</h3>

    <p>One technique for containing floats within a parent element is to use the CSS overflow property. Setting the
        overflow property value to auto within the parent element will contain the floats, resulting in an actual height
        for the parent element, thus including a gray background in our example.</p>

    <div class="overflow">
        <div class="box-set">
            <figure class="box">Box 1</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 2</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 3</figure>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Using the overflow technique does come with a few drawbacks. For example, when adding styles or moving nested
        elements that span outside of the parent, like when trying to implement box shadows and dropdown menus. In the
        demonstration below, you can see how the box shadow is being cut off wherever it lies outside the parent
        element. Additionally, the second box is cropped outside of the parent element.</p>

    <div class="overflow-bad">
        <div class="box-set">
            <figure class="box">Box 1</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 2</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 3</figure>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The Clearfix Technique</h3>

    <p>The clearfix technique is based off using the :before and :after pseudo-elements on the parent element. Using
        these pseudo-elements we can create hidden elements above and below the parent containing the floats. The
        :before pseudo-element is used to prevent the top margin of child elements from collapsing by creating an
        anonymous table-cell element using the display: table; declaration. This also helps ensure consistency within
        Internet Explorer 6 and 7. The :after pseudo-element is used to prevent the bottom margin of child elements from
        collapsing, as well as to clear the nested floats.</p>

    <div class="clearfix">
        <div class="box-set">
            <figure class="box">Box 1</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 2</figure>
            <figure class="box">Box 3</figure>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Effectively Containing Floats</h3>

    <p>Which techniques to use boils down to the content at hand and your personal preference. Some people prefer to
        stick strictly with the clearfix technique as it is consistent across the board. Others feel the clearfix
        technique is a bit too much code in some cases and prefer a mix of techniques based on the content. What you
        decide to use is up to you, just make sure it is well documented and easily identifiable either way.</p>

    <p>One common practice is to assign a class to the parent element which includes the floats needing to be
        contained. Using the clearfix technique for example, Dan Cederholm helped coin the class name group. The group
        class name can then be applied to any parent element needing to contain floats.</p>

    <code><pre>
.group:before,.group:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    }
.group:after {
    clear: both;
    }
.group {
    *zoom: 1;
    }</pre></code>

    <h4>Single Pseudo-Elements</h4>
    <p>It is worth noting only one :before and one :after pseudo-element are allowed per element, for the time being.
        When trying to use the clearfix technique with other :before and :after pseudo-element content you may not
        achieve the desired outcome.</p>
    <p>In the examples above, the clearfix styles would not live under the box-set class. Instead, the class of group
        would need to be added to the parent element containing the floats.</p>

    <h2>Position Property</h2>

    <p>Occasionally you need more control over the position of an element, more than a float can provide, in which case
        the position property comes into play. The position property accepts five different values, each of which
        provide different ways to uniquely position an element.</p>

    <h3>Position Static</h3>

    <p>Elements by default have the position value of static, meaning they don’t have, nor will they accept, any
        specific box offset properties. Furthermore, elements will be positioned as intended, with their default
        behaviors.</p>

    <p>In the demonstration below, all the boxes are stacked one on top of the other as they are block level elements
        and are not floated in any specific direction.</p>

    <div class="static">
        <figure class="boxx box-1">Box 1</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-2">Box 2</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-3">Box 3</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-4">Box 4</figure>
    </div>

    <h3>Position Relative</h3>

    <p>The relative value for the position property is very similar to that of the static value. The primary difference
        is that the relative value accepts the box offset properties top, right, bottom, and left. These box offset
        properties allow the element to be precisely positioned, shifting the element from its default position in any
        direction.</p>

    <h4>How Box Offset Properties Work</h4>

    <p>The box offset properties, top, right, bottom, and left, specify how elements may be positioned, and in which
        direction. These offset properties only work on elements with a relative, absolute, or fixed positioning value.
    </p>
    <p>For relatively positioned elements, these properties specify how an element should be moved from its default
        position. For example, using a top value of 20px on a relatively positioned element will push the element 20
        pixels down from where it was originally placed. Switching the top value to -20px will instead pull the element
        20 pixels up from where it was originally placed.</p>
    <p>For elements using absolute or fixed positioning these properties specify the distance between the element and
        the edges of its parent element. For example, using a top value of 20px on an absolutely positioned element will
        push the element 20 pixels down from the top of its relatively positioned parent. Switching the top value to
        -20px will then pull the element 20 pixels up from the top of its relatively positioned parent.</p>
    <p>While the relative position does accept box offset properties the element still remains in the normal, or static,
        flow of the page. In this case other elements will not impede on where the relatively positioned element was
        originally placed. Additionally, the relatively positioned element may overlap, or underlap, other elements
        without moving them from their default position.</p>
    <p>In the demonstration below you will notice that the elements are still stacked on top of one another, however
        they are shifted from their default positions according to their individual box offset property values. These
        values cause the boxes to overlap one another, yet do not push each other in different directions. When an
        element is positioned relatively the surrounding elements will observe the relatively positioned elements
        default position.</p>

    <div class="relative">
        <figure class="boxx box-1">Box 1</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-2">Box 2</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-3">Box 3</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-4">Box 4</figure>
    </div>

    <p>In the event that the top and bottom box offset properties are both declared on a relatively positioned element,
        the top properties will take priority. Additionally, if both the left and right box offset properties are
        declared on a relatively positioned element, priority is given in the direction in which the language of the
        page is written. For example, in English pages the left offset property is given priority, and for Arabic pages
        the right offset property is given priority.</p>

    <h3>Position Absolute</h3>

    <p>Absolutely positioned elements accept box offset properties, however they are removed from the normal flow of the
        document. Upon removing the element from the normal flow, elements are positioned directly in relation to their
        containing parent whom is relatively or absolutely positioned. Should a relatively or absolutely positioned
        parent not be present, the absolutely positioned element will be positioned in relation to the <code>body</code>
        of the page.</p>
    <p>Using absolutely positioned elements and specifying both vertical and horizontal offset properties will move the
        element with those property values in relation to its relatively positioned parent. For example, an element with
        a <code>top</code> value of <code>50px</code> and a <code>right</code> value of <code>100px</code> will position
        the element 50 pixels down from the top of its relatively positioned parent and 100 pixels in from the right of
        its relatively positioned parent.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, using an absolutely positioned element and not specifying any box offset property will position the
        element in the top left of its closest relatively positioned parent. Setting one box offset property, such as
        <code>top</code>, will absolutely position the element vertically but will leave the horizontal positioning to
        the default value of flush left.
    </p>
    <p>In the demonstration below you can see how each box is absolutely positioned in relation to the parent division,
        of which is relatively positioned. Each individual box is moved in from a specific side with a positive value,
        or pulled out from a specific side with a negative value.</p>


    <div class="absolute">
        <figure class="boxx box-1">Box 1</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-2">Box 2</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-3">Box 3</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-4">Box 4</figure>
    </div>

    <p>When an element has a fixed <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> and is absolutely positioned, the
        <code>top</code> property takes priority should both the <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> offset
        properties be declared. As with the relatively positioned elements, should an element with a fixed
        <code>width</code> have both the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> box offset properties, priority is
        given to the direction of which the language of the page is written.
    </p>

    <p>If an element doesn’t have a specific <code>height</code> or <code>width</code> and is absolutely positioned,
        using a combination of the <code>top</code> and <code>bottom</code> box offset properties displays an element
        with a height spanning the entire specified size. Same goes for using both the <code>left</code> and
        <code>right</code> box offset properties, resulting in an element with a full <code>width</code> based on both
        of the <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> box offset properties. Using all four box offset properties will
        display an element with a full specified height and width.
    </p>

    <h3>Position Fixed</h3>

    <p>Using the positioning value of <code>fixed</code> works just like that of <code>absolute</code>, however the
        positioning is relative to the browser viewport, and it does not scroll with the page. That said, elements will
        always be present no matter where a user stands on a page. The only caveat with <code>fixed</code> positioning
        is that it doesn’t work with Internet Explorer 6. Should you want to force <code>fixed</code> positioning within
        Internet Explorer 6 there are suitable hacks.</p>

    <p>Using multiple box offset properties with <code>fixed</code> positioning will produce the same behaviors as an
        absolutely positioned element.</p>

    <p>Using multiple box offset properties with <code>fixed</code> positioning will produce the same behaviors as an
        absolutely positioned element.</p>

    <div x-data="{ fixedClass: false }">
        <div x-bind:class="{ fixed: fixedClass }">
            <figure class="boxx box-1">Box 1</figure>
            <figure class="boxx box-2">Box 2</figure>
            <figure class="boxx box-3">Box 3</figure>
            <figure class="boxx box-4">Box 4</figure>
        </div>
        <button x-on:click="fixedClass = !fixedClass">Toggle fixed class</button>
    </div>

    <h4>Fixed Header or Footer</h4>

    <p>One of the most common uses of <code>fixed</code> positioning is to build a fixed header, or footer, anchored to
        one side of a page. As a user scrolls the element stays prevalent, always within the viewport for users to
        interact with.</p>

    <p>The code and demonstration below outline how this may be achieved. Notice how both <code>left</code> and
        <code>right</code> box offset properties are declared. This allows the <code>footer</code> to span the entire
        width of the bottom of the page, and it does so without disrupting the box model, allowing margins, borders, and
        padding to be applied freely.
    </p>


    <div x-data="{ footerClass: false }">
        <footer x-bind:class="{ footer: footerClass }">
            Fixed Footer
        </footer>

        <button x-on:click="footerClass = !footerClass">Toggle footer class</button>
    </div>

    <h2>Z-Index Property</h2>

    <p>By nature web pages are often considered to be two dimensional, displaying elements upon a <code>x</code> and
        <code>y</code> axis. However when you begin to position elements they are occasionally placed on top of one
        another. To change the order of <a
            href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/a-detailed-look-at-the-z-index-css-property/" rel="nofollow">how these
            elements are stacked</a>, also known as the z-axis, the <code>z-index</code> property is to be used.
    </p>
    <p>Generally, elements are positioned upon the z-axis as they appear within the DOM. Elements coming at the top of
        the DOM are positioned behind elements coming after them. Changing this stacking using the <code>z-index</code>
        property is pretty straight forward. The element with the highest <code>z-index</code> value will appear on the
        top regardless of its placement in the DOM.</p>

    <p>In order to apply the <code>z-index</code> property to an element, you must first apply a <code>position</code>
        value of <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, or <code>fixed</code>. The same as if you were to apply
        any box offset properties.</p>

    <p>In the example below, without the <code>z-index</code> property each box will be positioned precisely, starting
        with box two sitting on top of box one, then box three sitting on top of box two, and so forth. Reordering the
        stacking with the <code>z-index</code> property now positions box two on top of every other box, followed by box
        three underneath it, and box four underneath box three.</p>

    <div class="z-index">
        <figure class="boxx box-1">Box 1</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-2">Box 2</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-3">Box 3</figure>
        <figure class="boxx box-4">Box 4</figure>
    </div>
